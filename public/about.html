<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Abdurakhim Sadullaev, and I was born in 1996 in Tashkent,
  Uzbekistan, into a family of actors. Growing up in a vibrant and artistic
  environment, I was exposed to creativity and expression from a young age. My
  family was bilingual, and we spoke Uzbek and Russian at home. Later, I
  mastered English, which opened countless doors for me, and I’m now determined
  to learn Arabic as my next language. Mathematics has always been my strongest
  subject and a source of confidence throughout my education. I also developed a
  deep passion for PC gaming, which inspired me to dream of becoming a game
  creator. After graduating high school with excellent math skills, I pursued
  further education at Westminster University in Tashkent, where I studied
  Business Management. Although I didn’t complete my degree, the experience
  shaped my perspective and ambitions. In 2019, I moved to the United States, a
  transformative chapter in my life. Here, I’ve gained invaluable experiences,
  grown personally and professionally, and expanded my horizons. My journey is a
  testament to my love for learning, creativity, and perseverance, and I look
  forward to building a future where I combine my passions with my skills.
